# Operator

The OpenTelemetry Operator is a Kubernetes operator that manages the lifecycle of OpenTelemetry Collector instances, auto-instrumentation injection, target allocation, and OpAMP bridge on OpenShift. It defines five CRDs, but not all are documented or supported.

## Behavioral Rules

### CRDs

| CRD | API Version | Support Level | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| OpenTelemetryCollector | v1beta1 (storage version) | **GA** | Short names: `otelcol`, `otelcols` |
| Instrumentation | v1alpha1 | **TP** | See `what/auto-instrumentation.md`. Short names: `otelinst`, `otelinsts` |
| TargetAllocator | v1alpha1 (standalone) | **GA** | See `what/target-allocator.md`. Promoted from TP in 3.9.0 |
| OpAMPBridge | v1alpha1 | **Not supported** | Present in source, not documented |
| ClusterObservability | v1alpha1, cluster-scoped | **Not supported** | Present in source, not documented |

### Collector Modes

All four collector modes are **GA**:

1. Deployment mode (default): standard Kubernetes Deployment with configurable replicas.
2. DaemonSet mode: one collector pod per node.
3. StatefulSet mode: supports persistent storage via VolumeClaimTemplates.
4. Sidecar mode: injected into application pods. Sidecar mode prohibits tolerations, priorityClassName, affinity, and additionalContainers.

### Management State

5. **GA**: When `managementState` is `managed` (default), the operator reconciles the CR and manages all child resources.
6. **GA**: When `managementState` is `unmanaged`, the operator stops reconciling — the user controls child resources directly.

### Autoscaling

7. **GA**: HPA-based autoscaling is supported with CPU/memory utilization targets and custom metrics.
8. MinReplicas, MaxReplicas, and scaling behavior are configurable.

### Networking

9. **GA**: Ingress, HTTPRoute, and NetworkPolicy resources can be configured per collector instance.

### API Versioning

10. v1beta1 is the stable storage version for OpenTelemetryCollector.
11. v1alpha1 OpenTelemetryCollector is deprecated; its config field is a raw string, not structured.

### Operator Configuration

12. **GA**: The operator supports configuration via environment variables:
    - `OPENSHIFT_CREATE_DASHBOARD`: controls Grafana dashboard creation.
    - `ENABLE_CR_METRICS`: enables custom resource metrics.
    - `CREATE_SM_OPERATOR_METRICS`: creates ServiceMonitor for operator metrics.
    - `FEATURE_GATES`: enables/disables feature gates.
13. **GA**: The operator automatically creates RBAC resources required by collector components.

### TLS

14. **GA**: The operator adheres to cluster TLS security profiles (introduced in 3.10.0). The operator's own webhook and metrics servers, the collector operands it generates, and the Target Allocator all honour the profile. See `what/tls-profile.md` for the full propagation rules, configuration surface, and the `groups` (curve preferences) gap tracked by TRACING-6785.

### Features Not Supported

15. **Not supported**: OpAMPBridge — present in source but not documented. It connects to an OpAMP server endpoint and manages collector configurations.
16. **Not supported**: ClusterObservability CRD — present in source but not documented. Provides a simplified cluster-wide OTLP endpoint.

## Configuration Surface

| Field | Type | Default | Description | Support |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| spec.mode | Enum | `deployment` | Collector scheduling mode | **GA** |
| spec.replicas | int | 1 | Number of collector replicas | **GA** |
| spec.managementState | Enum | `managed` | Whether operator reconciles this CR | **GA** |
| spec.config | Structured | — | Collector pipeline configuration | **GA** |
| spec.targetAllocator.enabled | bool | false | Enable embedded target allocator | **GA** |
| spec.autoscaler | Object | — | HPA configuration | **GA** |
| spec.ingress | Object | — | Ingress configuration | **GA** |
| spec.configVersions | int | 3 | Number of config versions to retain | **GA** |

## Planned Changes

| Ticket | Summary |
|---|---|
| [PLANNED: needs ticket] | Register `webhook_event` receiver parser in `internal/components/receivers/helpers.go` with default port 8088 and alias `webhookeventreceiver`. Enables automatic Service port creation. See `what/collector-3.12-components.md`. |

## Constraints

1. The operator depends on `openshift/api` for OpenShift-specific integrations.
2. CRD types live in `apis/v1alpha1/` and `apis/v1beta1/` in the `opentelemetry-operator` repo.
3. E2E tests use the Chainsaw framework in the `tests/` directory.
