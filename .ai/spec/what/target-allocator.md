# Target Allocator

The Target Allocator distributes Prometheus scrape targets across OpenTelemetry Collector instances. It can be embedded in an OpenTelemetryCollector CR or managed as a standalone CRD.

The Target Allocator is **GA** (promoted from TP in 3.9.0).

## Behavioral Rules

### Allocation Strategies

1. **GA**: **consistent-hashing** (default): distributes targets using consistent hashing for stable assignment across collector instances.
2. **GA**: **least-weighted**: assigns targets to the collector instance with the fewest current targets.
3. **GA**: **per-node**: assigns targets to the collector instance running on the same node as the target.

### Filter Strategy

4. **GA**: **relabel-config** (default): applies Prometheus relabel_config rules to filter targets before allocation.
5. An empty filter strategy disables filtering.

### Prometheus CRD Integration

6. **GA**: When `prometheusCR.enabled` is true, the target allocator discovers scrape targets from Prometheus Operator CRDs: ServiceMonitor, PodMonitor, Probe, and ScrapeConfig.
7. Namespace selectors and label selectors can be configured independently for each Prometheus CRD type.
8. `scrapeInterval` defaults to 30s; `evaluationInterval` defaults to 30s.

### Collector Coordination

9. `collectorNotReadyGracePeriod` (default: 30s) defines how long to wait before redistributing targets from an unready collector.
10. `collectorTargetReloadInterval` (default: 30s) defines how often collectors poll for target updates.

### Security

11. mTLS can be configured between the target allocator and collector instances.
12. `allowInsecureAuthSecrets` controls whether auth secrets can be transmitted without TLS.
13. **[PLANNED: TRACING-6785]** When mTLS is enabled, the target allocator's HTTPS server adheres to the cluster TLS security profile (minimum version, cipher suites, and supported groups). mTLS is the only condition under which the target allocator serves TLS, so profile adherence is scoped to it. See `what/tls-profile.md`.

### Standalone CRD

14. **GA**: The standalone TargetAllocator CRD (v1alpha1) allows managing target allocation independently of an OpenTelemetryCollector CR.
15. It supports `globalConfig` and `scrapeConfigs` fields for direct Prometheus configuration.

## Configuration Surface

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| spec.allocationStrategy | Enum | `consistent-hashing` | How targets are distributed |
| spec.filterStrategy | Enum | `relabel-config` | How targets are filtered |
| spec.prometheusCR.enabled | bool | false | Discover targets from Prometheus CRDs |
| spec.prometheusCR.scrapeInterval | duration | `30s` | Default scrape interval |
| spec.collectorNotReadyGracePeriod | duration | `30s` | Grace period for unready collectors |
| spec.collectorTargetReloadInterval | duration | `30s` | Target reload poll interval |
| spec.mtls | Object | — | mTLS configuration |

## Constraints

1. The per-node allocation strategy requires collectors to run in DaemonSet mode to be meaningful.
2. PrometheusCR integration requires the Prometheus Operator CRDs to be installed on the cluster.
